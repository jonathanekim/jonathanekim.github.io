I was asked to create a new logo and brand for PitchBlast, a crowdfunding startup akin to [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/). The startup wanted to change names to *Wits and Pits*, so I began creating a logo based on that. I explored a variety of logo styles, from obvious to abstract:

![Image]({{ "/portfolio/2013/Wits-and-Pits/Wits-and-Pits_0.png" | relative_path }}){: .image-centered-full }

After discussion with the startup, we decided to move forward with a more abstract geometric logo that incorporated the shapes of the 'W', '+' ("and"), and 'P' glyphs:

![Image]({{ "/portfolio/2013/Wits-and-Pits/Wits-and-Pits_1.png" | relative_path }}){: .image-centered-medium }

We then decided on a simpler brand color palette, reflected in this updated logo:

![Image]({{ "/portfolio/2013/Wits-and-Pits/Wits-and-Pits_3.png" | relative_path }}){: .image-centered-medium }

The logo proved to be too abstract, so I revised it to be simpler (one block for 'W', one for 'P') and presented it alongside the site title to make the mapping more obvious. Although logos in left-to-right countries are typically placed to the right of the title, I aligned the logo to the right to emphasize the rhyme of the Wits and Pits name:

![Image]({{ "/portfolio/2013/Wits-and-Pits/Wits-and-Pits_4.png" | relative_path }}){: .image-centered-medium }

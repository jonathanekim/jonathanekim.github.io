I cofounded [The Simple Group](http://thesimplegroup.org/), a company that sought to maximize social impact investing and a reasonable capital appreciation with limited risk by funding microfinance loans in developing countries.

Finalizing a color palette was relatively straightforward:

The logo, on the other hand, went through many iterations. One of my personal favorite iterations referenced the financial aspect of the company:

However, the final logo was much simpler. It used the initials of the company:

Using the logo, I created various business card designs:

The final business cards were printed on thick black cards with embossed silver lettering:

I also made logos for Automa™, our algorithmic, high speed purchasing system. Automa™ was designed to screen for microfinance loans in 64 countries in real time and purchase high impact, low-risk loans.

After creating the TSG brand, I then designed and developed The Simple Group website ([http://thesimplegroup.org/](http://thesimplegroup.org/)) and realtime investor dashboard using Node.js and Angular.js.

I later completely redesigned and rebranded The Simple Group. The old design, although very friendly, didn't reflect the shift in the company from a fledgling startup to a mature investment fund. To help communicate The Simple Group's goal as a helping hand to entrepreneurs in developing countries, the new logo evokes the image of [cherubim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherub), heavenly guardians over the Garden of Eden.

And the rebranded website used the cherubim logo above a beautiful parallax image of the earth:

In early 2013, I and two other musicians formed a band comprising of male/female vocals, piano, guitar/drums, and cello. After fundraising for a short tour titled "Love: My City", we traveled around Florida and California in the summer of 2013, wrote and recorded originals and covers, and performed at several small venues.

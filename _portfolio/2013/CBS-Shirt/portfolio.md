CBS, a Cornell student club, holds an annual contest to design a t-shirt for its members. My submission to the t-shirt design contest was selected for the 2014 academic year.

## Shirt Back

The theme for the upcoming year was "Life as Mission". I designed a shirt back with the theme on it, as well as some cute ninjas being "on mission". The first and last ninjas took the shape of the "C" and "S" letters. The center ninja was a bee, a pun on the "B" in the CBS name.

## Shirt Front

CBS had a tradition where members would create personalized, decorated nametags to wear during weekly meetings. An example of some nametags (in this situation, I had modified others' nametags to say my name):

To pay homage to this tradition, I designed the front of the shirt with a "place nametag here" label over the right pocket where nametags are worn.

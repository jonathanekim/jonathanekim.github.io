I designed a logo for Emmaus Road, a local church. Initial iterations of the logo symbolized roads, but then I thought of an unique "heart on fire" design. The burning heart referenced [Luke 24:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+24%3A13-35&version=ESV):

> "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the [Emmaus] road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?"

![Image]({{ page.image_path | relative_path }}){: .image-centered-small }

I also designed two headers based on the logo:

![Image]({{ "/portfolio/2013/Emmaus_Road/Emmaus Website Header_white.png" | relative_path }}){: .image-centered-full }

![Image]({{ "/portfolio/2013/Emmaus_Road/KCCE.png" | relative_path }}){: .image-centered-medium }

Finally, I designed and developed a website and blog for the church using WordPress and my own theme: [http://emmauscornell.org](http://emmauscornell.org).

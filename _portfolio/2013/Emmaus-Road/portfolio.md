I designed the name, branding, and website for a local church (KCCE, Korean Church at Cornell English). I also developed a website for the church.

## Branding

I designed a new name and logo for the church, naming it "Emmaus Road". Initial iterations of the logo symbolized roads, but then I thought of an unique "heart on fire" design. The burning heart referenced [Luke 24:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+24%3A13-35&version=ESV):

> "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the [Emmaus] road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?"

I also designed two headers based on the logo.

## Website

Using my branding, I designed and developed a website ([http://emmauscornell.org](http://emmauscornell.org)) for the church using WordPress and my own theme.

My team at Google works to make self-expression both more personal and more efficient. One such project was selfie stickers, where a selfie photo is converted into stickers that can be sent to others. This project became available to the public in Allo towards the end of 2017.

## User Flow

To use the selfie stickers, users first captured a selfie:

Our project then used machine learning and neural nets to convert the selfie into an [Allo sticker pack](https://blog.google/products/allo/behind-design-selfie-stickers-google-allo/):

The ML algorithms were quite accurate at converting faces to selfie stickers, but users could also choose to further customize their stickers (face shape, hair, colors, hats, etc.):

A sample of various selfie stickers (these examples are from just one of two sticker packs available at release):
